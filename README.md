# Shell-Scripting

This is some basic shell scripting written for a first semester assignment. It is far from perfect as it is my first and only experience creating shells scripts in this way,
however the knowledge I gained from this is still invaluable to me.

Feel free to take the source code, make any adjustments or just play around with it.
